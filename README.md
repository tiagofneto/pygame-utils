# Pygame Utils
Utility tools (mainly widgets: buttons, checkboxes...) to use with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). 

## Installation
Just place the files in your working directory or in your site-packages folder.
I'm working on a more automatic way to install.

## Usage
So far there are 2 widgets available: button and checkbox.
The files are self-explanatory but in a near future I will be uploading a more in-depth guide.
